# Magic Store
The purpose of this library is to create a faux business "Magic Mins"

Magic store is an omnichannel business that sells magical items B2B and B2C. Sales occur in both brick & mortar stores and their own e-commerce webpage.

We want to use the available CRM and POS data to intelligently advice the executive management team in all facets of the business.
